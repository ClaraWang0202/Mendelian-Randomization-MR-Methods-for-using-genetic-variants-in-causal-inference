# Mendelian-Randomization-MR-Methods-for-using-genetic-variants-in-causal-inference

Our main goal is to find the causal inference between the exposure factors and the outcomes, but observational studies suffer from many potential biases, from confounding and from reverse causation, and this limits their ability to robustly identify causal relationships. To rule out the potential biases, using instrumental variable (IV)model. IV has a big advantage is that allow for consistent estimation. Using of instrumental variable (IV) approaches has been one approach to strengthen causal inferences in non-experimental situations. Next, how to find the suitable variable as IV? Then we use the Mendelian randomization (MR), because MR approach is based on the Mendelian genetic law, which is called” parental alleles that randomly assigned to the offspring”. MR refers to use of genetic variants to develop causal inferences from observational data. If the variant genotype is associated with the phenotype and the variant genotype associated with the risk of disease of interest through the phenotype, hence, the genotype/genetic variants can be used as instrumental variable to infer the causal relationship between phenotype and the risk of disease.
